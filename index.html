      <p>I grew up in a suburb just on the border of Philadelphia.  I developed a love for sports and video games as they were the outlets for my competetive side.  For this reason i gravitated towards computers from a very young age.  Whether it was looking up ways to improve my sports with videos on youtube or just beating my brother and father in Doom on the pc in the house i was always near it.</p>
